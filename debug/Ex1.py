# Step Challenge
# Three friends tracked their daily steps for one week.
# This program is supposed to:
#  1. Compute each person's average daily steps.
#  2. Award a badge based on that average:
#        Gold   - an average of 10,000 steps or more
#        Silver - an average of 7,500 steps or more
#        Bronze - anything less
#  3. Print a summary line for each person.
