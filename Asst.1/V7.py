# Interactive quiz system, sixth version
# Make a dictionary with the questions and correct answers
# Allow the user to choose the option by its label
# Improve the look and usability. Keep track of correct answers.
# Randomize the order of the questions and the order of the answers for each question.
# Refractor the code to use functions.
